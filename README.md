# Lab Skywars Session Tracker in C

This is a session tracker for the lab skywars hypixel minigame. There are many session trackers available but none of them count lab stats. This one is done in C using ncurses because I wanted to get better at c and making terminal interfaces.  

Requirements
- gcc (compiling)
- ncurses (compiling)
- Unix System (ncurses interface)
- Color Supported Terminal

Dowloading and Compiling
```
git clone https://www.github.com/baplou/lab-session.git
cd lab-session
gcc -lncurses -o main.c <name of executable>
./<name of executable>
```
